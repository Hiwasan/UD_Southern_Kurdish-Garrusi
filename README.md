# Summary

A dependency treebank in Universal Dependencies (UD) format, derived from narrative and questionnaire texts. This document gives an overview of the annotation scheme, linguistic features, and structural patterns seen in the data.
This treebank contains annotated sentences in an understudied Kurdish language variety called Garrusi (Indo-European), spoken in western regions of Iran (see Asadpour and Zarei, forthcoming). The data is formatted according to the Universal Dependencies (UD) guidelines (v2.11), with detailed morphosyntactic annotation and dependency structure. The language shows features such as verb serialization, possessive clitics, and light verb constructions.
Note: This README is based on the current state of the dataset, which includes 1,182 tokens. Some examples and tag distributions reflect larger internal versions of the corpus and might include sentences beyond the publicly released set.

# Linguistic Features
Garrusi exhibits several noteworthy syntactic phenomena:

Light Verb Constructions (LVCs): Productive noun + light verb combinations
Possessive Clitics: Systematic pronominal attachment patterns
Verb Serialization: Multiple verbs in sequence without overt coordination
Discourse Particles: Rich inventory of emphatic and discourse markers

## 2. Part-of-Speech (UPOS) Tagset

The treebank uses the standard UD POS tagset. Below is the full distribution:

| UPOS    | Count | Example(s)                                 |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------|
| 'VERB'  | 215   | dey 'give', kird 'do', bîn 'see'           |
| 'NOUN'  | 205   | kuř 'boy', duçerxe 'bicycle', timşa 'look' |
| 'PRON'  | 138   | y '3SG', ewe 'that', î 'his/her'           |
| 'ADP'   | 128   | we 'to/at', le 'from', naw 'in'            |
| 'ADV'   | 121   | red 'away', leyre 'there', temami 'all'    |
| 'DET'   | 67    | yê 'the', ew 'that'                        |
| 'PUNCT' | 58    | Sentence and quotation punctuation         |
| 'NUM'   | 52    | sê 'three', dane 'two'                     |

# Key Syntactic Patterns

## Light Verb Constructions
The most frequent pattern involves a semantically heavy noun combined with a light verb, annotated using compound:lvc:

sent_id = 92,

text = Kuřêş ki we duçerxewe řikab deygo.

### "The boy who pedals the bicycle."

5  řikab    řikab    NOUN  _  Number=Sing        6  compound:lvc  _  _

6  deygo    dagin    VERB  _  Mood=Ind|Tense=Pres  0  root         _  _

Structure: NOUN[compound:lvc] → VERB[root]

Meaning: řikab dey = "to pedal" (lit. "give pedal")


## Possessive Constructions
Possessive relationships use pronominal clitics marked with nmod:poss:

sent_id = 31,

text = Timşay bawkî kird.

### "(He) looked at his father."

3  bawk  bawk  NOUN  _  Number=Sing                    5  obl       _  _

4  î     î     PRON  _  Person=3|Number=Sing|Anim=Anim  3  nmod:poss _  _

Structure: NOUN ← PRON[nmod:poss]

Features: Possessive pronouns carry Person, Number, and Animacy


## Multi-word Tokens
Pronominal clitics are systematically separated from their hosts:

3-4  bawkî  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _

3    bawk   bawk  NOUN  _  Number=Sing     5  obl       _  _  

4    î      î     PRON  _  Person=3|...    3  nmod:poss _  _

Policy: Pronominal clitics split; morphological affixes (definiteness, case) remain attached.


## Auxiliary Verbs ('AUX')
Only 4 instances of 'AUX' are annotated, all from the verb 'daştin' ("to be").

| Token  | Lemma    | Function                        | DEPREL | Sentence        |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 'dîrî' | 'daştin' | Progressive aspect ("is doing") | 'aux'  | #79, #146, #182 |
| 'e'    | 'e'      | Existential/copular "be"        | 'cop'  | #82, #88        |


#### Example:
sent_id = 79,

text = Yê dane kuř dîrî we duçerxi’o lewre řed dû 

→ "A boy is passing by there on a bike."

---

# Discourse Markers
Garrusi employs various particles for emphasis and discourse organization:

## Particles ('PART')

The PART tag is used for discourse particles and emphatic words.

| Token  | POS    | Sentence | Function                  | Example Context
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 'erî'  | PART   | #115     | "each", "every"           | Distributive meaning      | 
| 'he'   | PART   | #95      | emphatic "just", "really" | Verb modification         |
| 'xodi' | PART   | #208     | "hey!", "listen!"         | Attention-getting         |
| 'ewse' | PART   | #73, #82 | "that's it", "exactly"    | Sentence-initial emphasis |

1  Ewse    Ewse  PART  _  _  4  discourse  _  _

2  nişan   nişan NOUN  _  _  4  compound:lvc _  _  

4  dey     dan   VERB  _  _  0  root       _  _

# "That's it, (he) shows (it)."

---

## 3. Morphological Features (FEATS)

These are the morphological features used in the annotation, along with their values and notes.

| **Feature** | **Possible Values**   | **Notes**                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 'Person'    | '1', '2', '3'         | Marks person on verbs and pronouns            |
| 'Number'    | 'Sing', 'Plur'        | Seen on verbs, nouns, and pronouns            |
| 'Tense'     | 'Past', 'Pres', 'Fut' | Verb tense categories                         |
| 'Mood'      | 'Ind', 'Sub', 'Imp'   | Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative           |
| 'VerbForm'  | 'Fin'                 | Only finite forms in current dataset          |
| 'Voice'     | 'Act', 'Pass', 'Cau'  | Active, Passive, and Causative voice          |
| 'Aspect'    | 'Perf', 'Imp'         | Perfective and Imperfective aspects           |
| 'Definite'  | 'Def', 'Ind', 'Spec'  | For definiteness and specificity              |
| 'Animacy'   | 'Hum', 'Anim', 'Inan' | Used on pronouns and nouns                    |
| 'ExtPos'    | 'ADP'                 | External POS used for MWTs (e.g. in 'we ban') |

There are no non-finite verbs (Inf, Part) in the current dataset, but that may change in larger releases.

# Annotation Guidelines

## Tokenization and Segmentation
### Basic Principles:

Words segmented based on whitespace and punctuation boundaries
Pronominal clitics separated as individual tokens
Morphological affixes (case, definiteness) remain attached to host
Multi-word tokens (MWT) used for clitic-host combinations

#### Clitic Treatment:
| **Clitic Type** | **Segmentation Rule**     | **Example**             | **Annotation**          |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 'Pronominal'    | Always separated          | mîveganî → mîvegan + î  | 3-4 mîveganî            |
| 'Prepositional' | Separated if grammatical  | kirde → kird + e        | 1-2 kirde               |
| 'Postpositional'| Host-attached             | we desmalo → we desmalo | Single tokens           |

#### Multi-Word Token (MWT) Format:
3-4  bawkî     _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _

3    bawk      bawk  NOUN  _  Number=Sing     5  obl       _  _

4    î         î     PRON  _  Person=3|...    3  nmod:poss _  _

## Lemmatization Standards

### Verbal Lemmas:

Infinitive form where available: dey → dan, kird → kirdin

Root form for irregular verbs: bî → bun

Light verbs maintain semantic form: dey → dan (not reduced)

### Nominal Lemmas:

Singular, indefinite form: kuřan → kuř

Base form without possessive markers: bawkî → bawk

Compound nouns as single lemma: duçerxe → duçerxe

## Dependency Relations

#### Core Relations:

compound:lvc: Noun-to-verb in light verb constructions

nmod:poss: Possessive pronoun modifying noun

discourse: Sentence-level particles (ewse, xodi)

fixed: Multi-word adpositions (we ban)

#### Light Verb Constructions:

Direction: NOUN[compound:lvc] → VERB[head]

Features: Noun carries semantic content; verb grammaticalized

#### Possessive Constructions:

Direction: NOUN ← PRON[nmod:poss]

Features: Pronoun marked for Person|Number|Animacy|Definite


## Morphological Annotation

### Feature Assignment:

Verbs: Person, Number, Tense, Mood, Voice, Aspect

Pronouns: Person, Number, Animacy, Definiteness

Nouns: Number, Definiteness (when overt)

### Consistency Rules:

Possessive clitics always carry full pronominal features

Light verbs retain full verbal morphology

Discourse particles minimally specified

Some edge cases need review — like dep, or where fixed was not accepted by the annotation tool.

### root — Sentence Root
Marks the main verb or clause head.

sent_id = 79,  
text = Yê dane kuř dîrî we duçerxi’o lewre řed dû.

## 5. Notes on Annotation Decisions and Future Review
The following points highlight areas where annotation choices may be revisited in future updates. These do not impact overall usability but are shared here for transparency and reference.

| **Issue**                                             | **Description**                                       | **Recommendation**                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 'ewse' tagged as both 'PART' and 'INTJ'               | Same token used with inconsistent UPOS tags           | Standardize 'ewse' to 'PART' when it functions as a discourse marker                         |
| 'her' tagged as 'PART' but linked with 'dep' relation | Usage unclear; might not be a true particle           | Change relation from 'dep' to 'discourse' or 'advmod'                                        |
| Use of 'ExtPos=ADP' on 'we', 'naw'                    | Used to indicate multi-word adpositional phrases      | Clarify annotation policy or remove if not used consistently                                 |
| No non-finite verb forms present                      | Only 'VerbForm=Fin' appears in data                   | Add 'VerbForm=Inf' and 'Part' if non-finite forms are added later                            |
| 'dep' relation used for unclear cases                 | Used as a placeholder where no specific DEPREL fits   | Review all 'dep' cases and relabel with more precise relations ('discourse', 'advmod', etc.) |
| MWT boundaries not fully consistent                   | Some clitics treated as part of word, others split    | Review MWT segmentation rules for pronominal vs. non-pronominal clitics                      |
| Definite marker '-ege' treated inconsistently         | Sometimes stays attached; other times unclear         | Provide clear guideline: treat '-ege' as part of host word consistently                      |
| Arobator platform rejects some 'fixed' relations      | Affects certain clitic combinations like 'we desmalo' | Consider workaround tagging or flagging limitations in documentation                         |
